### Example call

`python bin/MutaRNA-plot.py --fasta-wildtype data/sample0.fa --SNP-tag G3C --out-dir ./results/`

### Output
Outputs are stored under the current directory (by default) or the specified path via `--out-dir` option. 

* Local 

The results under the `local/` directory contain the visualization of base-pairing probabilities as computed by RNAplfold under different conditions. The plots are generated in two file formats (`.png` and `svg`). 

    - `RNA-WILD-circos`: The base pair probabilities of the wild type in circular Circos form. 
    - `RNA-MUTANT-circos`: The base pair probabilities of the mutant in circular Circos form. 
    - `RNA-MUTANT-removed-circos`: The weakened base-pairing potentials in the form of probability difference between WT and mutant.
    - `RNA-MUTANT-introduced-circos`: The increased base-pairings potentials in the form of probability difference between mutant and WT.
    - `RNA-WT-MUT-dotplot`: The base pair probabilities of the wild type (upper right) and mutant (lower left) in dotplot-style matrix format heatmap plots.
    - `RNA-REMOVED-INTRODUCED-dotplot`: The weakened base-pairing potentials in the form of probability difference between WT and mutant (upper right). The increased base-pairings potentials in the form of probability difference between mutant and WT (lower left).
    - `RNA_lunp-ECG` The position-wise unpaired probability, also know as accessibility, of wild type, mutant and their difference.

* Global 

The results under the `global/` directory contain the visualization of base-pairing probabilities as computed by RNAplfold. Similar to the local mode but allowing for large base-pair span over the sequence length in a single window. under different conditions. The plots are generated in two file formats (`.png` and `svg`). 

* Predicted structural impact of the mutation:

    - `remuRNA.csv` : prediction scores by remuRNA. remuRNA score `(H(WT||MUT))`is the relative entropy between the ensemble of structures in wild type versus mutant RNA. The score reflects the changes in the global structure of the RNA.
    - `RNAsnp.csv` : prediction scores by RNAsnp. RNAsnp scores are generated in two modes (`-m 1`, `-m 2`) of  (semi-)global and local folding and based on the two metrics of base-pairing distance (`d_max`) in both modes and correlation coefficient (`r_min`). RNAsnp further computes the significance of score in term of  `p-value`s against a pre-computed table of sequence with similar features.
